        <h1>KATRINA MENG</h1>
        <!--Update with your name-->
        <p>My name is Katrina and this is my website for <i>IML300 class</i>. I'm a junior double majoring in Linguistics and Media Arts + Practice at USC. I was born and raised in Shanghai, China, where I developed an affinity for rainy days and long walks after dinner. Hello Kitty is my spirit animal. She's unapologetically attention-grabbing; she's the main character; she's like Barbie except that she's also Asian.</p>

    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <h2> Jan. 25</h2>
    <p>This piece brings up questions I’ve never thought about or heard of, but I guess such reactions are exactly why articles like this need to be written. I like how the article itself takes the initiative to use black as the background color with white text. And then it indeed struck me as counterintuitive that white screen is used as the default just like a piece of paper to write on, and how neither of these mediums are naturally white, but made to be so in order to look pure and credible.

    <p>Q1.What are some of the ways in which a black screen can benefit minority groups?
        <br>Q2.With all the plug-ins that we have today to adjust colors of the user interface, does American artist’s claim have less weight?
        <br>Q3.How does the whiteness or blackness of the screen affects the way we look at digital media today, especially via phone screens, where videos are supposed to take up the entire screen with an array of colors?
    </p>

    <h2> Feb.1</h2>
    <p>It’s interesting to see early advertisements and how-to videos for the internet, especially the ways they try to contextualize something so new and abstract. I can only imagine the excitement of those witnessing the introduction of the internet and realizing how they can utilize it to communicate with people so far away. There is a sense of simplicity to this early period of internet where everyone has autonomy as to what they want to explore on the internet. I never noticed that many illustrations of the internet were about highways or cables that lead somewhere, but now it all makes sense — they embodied distance and speed. It’s inspiring that the reading points out how now the capitalists control what we see on the internet, with sponsorships and ads, and they also have the power to take down content. It made me realize that we need to think critically when we get information from the internet.</p>


    <p>Q1.What could be the difference of people born “before the internet” and after? Is there such a thing as “thinking digitally”?
        <br>Q2.As the internet space becomes more complex and involves more commercial interest, is it evolving to be closer to how the real world functions?
        <br>Q3.How does anonymity play a role in discourses on the internet? Do people make more meaningful remarks as their identities are hidden, or do they comment more carelessly due to the same reason?
    </p>
    <h2>Feb. 15</h2>
    <p>I love all the projects that were mentioned in the talk, and the follower app especially reminded me of the movie Amelie. I can definitely related to the curiosity about minds beyond the digital screen and wanting life to be something more. I feel like these projects speak to an inquiry of identity and anonymity in the age of the internet, and Lauren definitely has a lot of trust that the internet did not change the romantic and lonely parts in people. Constructing her projects around serious topics such as surveillance and the capabilities of algorithms, I feel like she manages to also take a very personal approach in what she does, which I love.</p>

    <p>Q1. A lot of Lauren’s projects seemed experimental. How did she find so many people to participate?
        <br>Q2.I actually wonder in her project Lauren, how she was able to monitor so many houses at the same time and respond to each request all the time.
        <br>Q3.What are some of the steps taken to address the need of minority groups in open source libraries?
    </p>

    <h2>Feb. 22</h2>
    <p>I agree with the reading that the poor quality of images on the internet embodies a sense of reality and traces of humanity. I also feel like the blurriness of the image itself adds a layer of meaning to the image, showing that it is not formal or professional but meant to entertain. A lot of the memes are purposely made to be of poor quality because the sense of humor comes from that carelessness and sarcasm. With a generation of netizens that finds humor in randomness, blurry images and unrelated texts create the most common memes that people find funny, and you just can’t start to explain why that is.</p>

    <p>Q1.How does sarcasm in memes affect how people consume them when they can be easily taken in the wrong way?
        <br>Q2.How does consuming poor quality images affect our understanding and taste for high quality images and elaborate details?
        <br>Q3.Will poor quality images continue to be popular now that images can be easily made higher resolution?
    </p>

    <h2>Mar. 1</h2>
    <p>This TED talk reminds me of a slam poetry that also focuses on algorithmic bias of programs by predominantly white groups of designers. I remember relating very much to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDEVYzOSKpA&list=LL&index=226&ab_channel=ButtonPoetry">this poetry</a> because Apple has also autocorrected my friends’ Chinese names, which is hilarious at times but has much deeper implications regarding the systemic exclusion of minority cultures and even people in the US. It’s mind blowing to see this exclusion in the form of a facial recognition software, as biases are amplified and reinforced through algorithm, which has often been recognized as objective. This goes to show how important it is for the tech industry to be inclusive when it comes to the people writing algorithms and testing the programs. </p>

    <p>Q1.What are the larger implications of such biases in programs other than failed facial recognitions?
        <br>Q2.What steps can be taken to eliminate bias in algorithms?
        <br>Q3.How can we remind people to be mindful/critical of the biases that already exist in the programs?
    </p>

    <h2>Mar. 8 </h2>
    <p>The reading and the ted talk both bring up important ideas that I would never have empathized with otherwise. I just realized how fortunate I am to have a platform to tell my own stories, and how my ability to do so is not available to everyone. I resonate with Adichie’s experience of having pre-conceived notions of a people and place based on limited stories I have heard about them, and also hearing statements that start with “all these Chinese international students”. I think it’s one thing for platforms to be available for underrepresented groups, and another for their work to be taken seriously. And I think the latter is important for artists to think about when it comes to representation and making social change.</p>

    <p>Q1.How can artists make social changes through telling their authentic stories?
        <br>Q2.What are some concrete steps we can take to make creative coding more inclusive?
        <br> Q3.How do we raise interest towards the stories of underrepresented groups?
    </p>

    <h2>Mar. 29 </h2>

    <p> I was really inspired by this talk and found a lot of connections it has to the readings for my other class. I think it counters a lot of the problems of neoliberalism where everyone pictures an idealized future without planning out concrete steps, and getting drained within the system instead of envisioning a new one that is more sustainable. I especially resonated with her argument that we should design “with” not “for”, as I often find it hard to make arbitrary design choices when I don’t know what my audience needs. I agree that in order to create art that is more accessible and inclusive, it is important to stay grounded in the real world and consider the implications of every artistic choice we make.</p>

    <p>Q1.What are some steps that can be taken to be more inclusive of different backgrounds in the art community?
        <br>Q2.How do we balance benefiting from natural resources and achieving sustainability?
        <br>Q3.How do we know that we are working towards sustainability as we live in the present?
    </p>

    <h2>Apr. 8 </h2>

    <p> 
        I enjoyed <a href = "https://newart.city/show/watched-over-by-machines-of-loving-grace">this exhibit</a>, especially the space called Non-Fungible Person. I feel like the entire project ties into itself really well, and the 4 spaces build upon each other to tell a cohesive story. The spaces are all elaborately designed and fun to look at, as opposed to just a pile of 3D models. The music also works really well to establish the mood of different spaces. I like how the creator uses scale(e.g. size of the human figures) to show emotion as well. And I love the idea of creating a secret space in an exhibit - while the artist is narrating I feel like I can get to know them on a personal level and all the abstract expressions start to make sense. I also like how you are unable to control your pace in some parts of the exhibit as it adds surprises to the piece.</p>
