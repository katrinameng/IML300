You told Harpo to beat me, she said. <br>
No I didn't, I said.<br>
Don't lie, she said.<br>
I didn't mean it, I said.<br>
Then what you say it for? She ast.<br>
She standing there looking me straight in the eye. She look tired and her jaw full of air.<br>
I say it cause I'm a fool, I say. I say it cause I'm jealous of you. I say it cause you do what I can't.<br>
What that? She say.<br>
Fight. I say.
